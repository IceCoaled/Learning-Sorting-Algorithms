# Learning Data Structures & Algorithms
just learning some basic data structures and algorithms

### Requirements
- Only uses basic standard library stuff
- Now uses std::generator and stuff in thread
header that can easily be removed

### Performance Check
- Run main to see performance of sorting algorithms

### Future
- I will be slowly adding more stuff to this repo as i learn
- Search algorithms
- Data structures
- Possibly more sorting algorithms
